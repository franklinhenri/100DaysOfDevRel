## Platform vs Product

A product is consumer centric. It serves the need of the end-users. On the other hand, a platform is both producer *and* consumer centric. A platform, from the company perspective, has to empower the producers to create. Producers in our case include partners, third-party developers, hobbyists etc.

A platform is characterized by it's ability to extend a product. Products can also transition into platforms. And when they do, it is imperative to provide a good developer experience (DX). It is analogous to user experience (UX) which can determine the success or failure of a product. Reaping the benefits of good DX/UX translates into successful adoption.
