## Developer Personas

A persona represents a fictional character which is created based upon research. Tailoring our efforts and initiatives for each developer might be a challenge. However, with **developer personas**, it is easy. Developer personas are fictional representative developers of the relevant product/platform developer population. Interactions through events, support and hands-on sessions would give more insights into such personas. 

Each persona has different traits and journeys that are specific to a product or a platform. When we walk in the shoes of such personas, we get a different perspective of the platform or the product that we may not realize otherwise. It is important to describe each persona and distinguish from the other personas by hypothesising and having a team-wide consensus. Any effort or intiative can then be tested upon those personas to determine the level of value that it brings.
