## Developer Outreach

> "A handshake is worth more than a click" - Tim Falls

Developer Outreach is an important aspect to raise awareness, improve understanding and most importantly, build a relationship with the developers. It shares few aspects of marketing however has a stark contrast when it comes to the type of audience. The audience here is the developers who are technically sound and are direct beneficiaries of the product/platform features. They are extremely aware of what they are going to deal with and anything that is marketed to them will be put to test. 

An outreach program might typically involve direct interaction,creating and sharing blogs online, meetups/ events offline etc. Such activities nurture relationships and also build trust with the developers.
