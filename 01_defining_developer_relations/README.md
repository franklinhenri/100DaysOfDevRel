# Defining Developer Relations üîç

## What exactly is Developer Relations ? 

Developer Relations (DevRel) is all about maintaining a _positive_ relationship between a company and its relevant developer community. 

## Why Developer Relations ?
As you might have already guessed, DevRel act as an interface between the developer community and the company's engineering/product teams. From the company's perspective, they are the zeroth customer for the developer platform. From the developer's perspective, they offer guidance on behalf of the company and act as a representative. Striking the right balance ensures a great _developer experience_ and also benefits the company.
