## Guidelines

Guidelines are general rules, principles or piece of advice. For a product/platform, we put forth guidelines so that we don't have to repeat it everytime. The guidelines are in place so that they are adhered to while the producers(developers) create stuff (apps/content) in the marketplace. It is also to make sure that the consumers have a consistent experience with the product and the apps. Examples of such guidelines include : Design Guidelines, App Submission guidelines, Interaction guidelines, Community guidelines, etc.
