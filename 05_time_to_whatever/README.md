## Time-to-Whatever

Time is important, it is the currency of life and the greatest gift that we all received. We have a plethora of metrics built around time that we might call  '_time-to-**x**_' - Time-to-market, time-to-fix, time-to-deploy to name a few. By now, it should've been obvious that if we were to borrow someone else's time or grab someone's attention, it is ephemeral. It is even more short-lived for developers who have to juggle between multiple tasks. 

If a product or platform can offer value to the developer in a short time, it is a sure shot sign of success. To establish a positive relationship with the partners/developers, reduce the time-to-value.
