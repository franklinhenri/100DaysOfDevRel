## Developer Experience (DX)

Developer Experience has become a critical component in deciding the success of a product. It is sacrosanct to platform companies that wish to increase developer adoption. Although this isn't something new, the awareness and the need to provide great developer experience is gaining momentum lately.

Much like User Experience(UX)[1], Developer Experience refers to a developer's *emotions* and *attitudes* about using a particular product, system or service. Typically, a developer might come across the platform/product documentation, tools, APIs, support on a regular basis. Needless to say, companies are increasingly getting dependant upon APIs. In such scenarios, it is important to ensure that developers face less challenges while working with the aforementioned. 

In terms of productivity, good DX ensures developers are able to do what they want to do without much resistance. This is beneficial to both the company and its end-users. In certain cases, developers greatly influence a company's decision to buy a particular product!
